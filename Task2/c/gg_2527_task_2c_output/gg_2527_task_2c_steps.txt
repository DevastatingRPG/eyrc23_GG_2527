'''
1. I first opened the marked image of the arena and identified aruco markers to use as reference to crop out the required parts.
2. I then applied the changes to the corner coordinates to get perfect crop.
3. I then extracted the selected region of interest from arena image to get np array of each image for selected area.
4. Formed a list of these areas and used it for event_identification function.
5. For Classification, Since this resolution was roughly 50x50 i upscaled it using EDSR model because it wasn't as accurate 
yet due to the low resolution.
